1. Skills Match (0-100):
   - How many required/preferred skills do you have?
   - Are you proficient in key technologies/tools mentioned?

2. Experience Match (0-100):
   - Does your experience level align with requirements?
   - Do you have relevant years of experience?

3. Role Alignment (0-100):
   - Does the job title/role match your career trajectory?
   - Are the responsibilities similar to your past roles?

4. Industry Fit (0-100):
   - Does your industry experience match?
   - Will you understand the business context?

5. Career Growth (0-100):
   - Is this a logical next step in your career?
   - Does it offer growth opportunities?

- Use imperative verbs: "Complete...", "Build...", "Learn...", "Take..."
- DO NOT use vague phrases like "explore opportunities", "engage in networking", "pursue certifications", "enhance understanding"
