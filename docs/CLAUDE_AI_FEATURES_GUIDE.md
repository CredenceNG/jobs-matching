  { maxResults: 20, minScore: 0.6 }
);

// Returns: matches, summary, topRecommendations
```

#### 2. Cover Letter Service
```typescript
import { coverLetterService } from '@/lib/ai/cover-letter';

const coverLetter = await coverLetterService.generateCoverLetter(
  userId,
  {
    userProfile,
    jobListing,
    tone: 'professional',
    length: 'medium',
    focusAreas: ['leadership', 'technical expertise']
  }
);

## 🔐 API Routes (Next Steps)

Create these API endpoints to expose features:

```typescript
// app/api/ai/job-match/route.ts
POST /api/ai/job-match
Body: { userId, userProfile, jobs }
Returns: { matches, summary }

// app/api/ai/cover-letter/route.ts
POST /api/ai/cover-letter
Body: { userId, userProfile, jobListing, tone, length }
Returns: { content, keyPoints, suggestedEdits }

// app/api/ai/resume-optimize/route.ts
POST /api/ai/resume-optimize
Body: { userId, userProfile, jobListing, format }
Returns: { content, atsScore, matchedKeywords }
```

## ✨ Features

### Current
- ✅ Job matching with detailed analysis
- ✅ Professional cover letter generation
