# ✅ AI Activation Checklist

## 🎯 Current Status: Ready for AI Credits

Your system is **95% complete**. Only thing missing: AI credits ($5-10)

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Add OpenAI Credits (5 minutes)

- [ ] **1.1** Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- [ ] **1.2** Click "Add to credit balance"
- [ ] **1.3** Add payment method (if not already added)
- [ ] **1.4** Add **$10** credits (recommended) or minimum $5
- [ ] **1.5** Wait 1-2 minutes for credits to show

**Why $10?**
- Gives you 600-1000 resume searches
- Cheap insurance against running out mid-demo
- OpenAI doesn't auto-charge (prepaid only)

---

### ✅ Step 2: Verify AI Works (2 minutes)

- [ ] **2.1** Open terminal in project folder
- [ ] **2.2** Run: `node test-api-keys.mjs`
- [ ] **2.3** Verify you see: `✅ OpenAI: WORKING (73 models available)`
- [ ] **2.4** Run: `node test-ai-functionality.mjs`
- [ ] **2.5** Verify you see: `✅ AI Analysis Test: PASSED`

**If you see errors:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes (credits may be processing)
- Check https://platform.openai.com/account/usage (usage should show)
- Try test again

---

### ✅ Step 3: Test Resume Analysis (3 minutes)

- [ ] **3.1** Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] **3.2** Open browser: http://localhost:3000/resume-jobs
- [ ] **3.3** Upload test resume: `marketing-resume.txt` (in project root)
- [ ] **3.4** Wait 15-20 seconds
- [ ] **3.5** Check server logs for:
  ```
  🤖 STEP 2: Analyzing resume with AI...
  ✅ AI Analysis Complete:
     - Skills found: 15
     - Job titles: Marketing Manager
  ```

**If analysis fails:**
- Check server console for errors
- Verify credits added: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
- Run `node test-api-keys.mjs` again

---

### ✅ Step 4: Verify Job Scraping Works (1 minute)

- [ ] **4.1** In server logs, look for:
  ```
  🕷️  Attempting web scraper search...
  🔍 [Indeed] Starting scrape for "..."
  🔍 [RemoteOK] Starting scrape for "..."
  ✅ Web scrapers found 32 jobs from indeed, remoteok
     Duplicates removed: 8
  ```

**If scraping fails:**
- Scrapers need Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`
- Check internet connection
- Try: `node test-integration.mjs`

---

### ✅ Step 5: Verify AI Job Scoring (1 minute)

- [ ] **5.1** In server logs, look for:
  ```
  🎯 STEP 3B: Scoring jobs with AI...
  ✅ AI Scoring Complete!

  📊 Top 3 matches:
     1. Marketing Manager at TechCorp - 92% match
     2. Digital Marketing Lead at SaaS Co - 88% match
     3. Brand Manager at E-commerce Inc - 85% match
  ```

**If scoring fails:**
- Most likely: ran out of credits mid-request
- Add more credits
- Try again with fresh upload

---

### ✅ Step 6: Check Results in Browser (1 minute)

- [ ] **6.1** In browser, verify you see:
  - List of job postings
  - Company names and locations
  - Job descriptions
  - (Match scores will show once you add that to UI)

**If no jobs show:**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Check server logs for API errors
- Try different search terms

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "Quota exceeded" error

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ OpenAI API Error:
   Status: 429

```

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

```

**Solution:**
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`

**Solution:**
1. Check if scrapers ran: look for `🕷️  Attempting web scraper search...`
2. Check API fallbacks: look for `🔄 Falling back to API-based job search...`
3. Verify Adzuna API works: `node test-api-keys.mjs`
4. Try different keywords (e.g., "developer" instead of specific tech)

---

### Problem: "AI analysis failed"

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ Failed to process resume
```

**Solution:**
1. Check AI credits: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
2. Verify API key: `node test-api-keys.mjs`
3. Check resume file is valid (not corrupted PDF)
4. Try TXT file instead of PDF
