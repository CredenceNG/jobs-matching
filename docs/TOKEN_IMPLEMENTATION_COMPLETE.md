## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

#### Option A: Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/itopa/projects/jobai-search
supabase db push
```

#### Option B: Supabase Dashboard (Manual)
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com → Your Project → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/002_add_token_system.sql`
3. Paste and run
4. Copy contents of `supabase/seed/002_token_data.sql`
5. Paste and run

### Step 2: Update Stripe Products

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Products
2. Create 5 new products for token packages:
   - Starter: $5.00 (one-time payment)
   - Basic: $10.00 (one-time payment)
   - Pro: $20.00 (one-time payment) - Mark as featured
   - Power: $40.00 (one-time payment)
   - Enterprise: $100.00 (one-time payment)
3. Copy the Price IDs
4. Update `token_packages` table with Stripe Price IDs:
   ```sql
   UPDATE token_packages SET stripe_price_id = 'price_xxx' WHERE tier = 'starter';
   UPDATE token_packages SET stripe_price_id = 'price_xxx' WHERE tier = 'basic';
   -- etc.
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Stripe Webhook

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhooks`
3. Select events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy webhook signing secret
5. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
   ```

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:
```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJxxx
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJxxx

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
```

### Step 5: Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to:
- `/pricing-hybrid` - View pricing options
- `/tokens/buy` - Purchase tokens (use Stripe test cards)
- Test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (any future expiry, any CVC)

- [ ] `POST /api/tokens/deduct` reduces balance correctly
- [ ] `GET /api/tokens/costs` returns all feature costs
- [ ] `GET /api/tokens/packages` returns all packages
- [ ] `POST /api/tokens/purchase` creates Stripe PaymentIntent

## 🎯 How to Use TokenGate

Wrap any AI feature with TokenGate:

```typescript
import { TokenGate } from '@/components/tokens';

// In your component:
<TokenGate
  featureKey="cover_letter"
  featureName="Generate Cover Letter"
  description="AI will create a tailored cover letter for this job"
  onConfirm={async () => {
    // Your feature logic here
    const coverLetter = await generateCoverLetter(jobId);
    setCoverLetter(coverLetter);
  }}
>
  <button className="px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-xl">
    Generate Cover Letter
  </button>
</TokenGate>
```

**What TokenGate does**:
1. Shows token cost badge above button
2. Checks if user can afford feature
3. Shows confirmation modal when clicked
4. Deducts tokens via API
5. Executes your feature logic
6. Handles errors gracefully
7. Refreshes balance after success

---

## 📊 Expected User Flows

### Flow 1: New User (Free → Tokens)
1. User tries job matching (free)
2. Wants to generate cover letter (premium)
3. Clicks "Generate" → See token cost
4. Doesn't have tokens → Redirect to buy page
5. Selects $5 Starter package (100 tokens)
6. Completes Stripe payment
7. Redirected to success page
8. Tokens credited instantly
9. Returns to generate cover letter
10. Success! (88 tokens remaining)

### Flow 2: Active User (Tokens → Subscription)
1. User has 50 tokens left
2. Uses features frequently
3. Sees "running low" warnings
4. Goes to pricing page
5. Compares tokens vs subscription
6. Chooses $5/month unlimited subscription
7. All features now show "Unlimited"
8. No token deductions
9. 50 tokens remain for later (never expire)

### Flow 3: Power User (Subscription Only)
1. User signs up → Chooses subscription immediately
2. Skips tokens entirely
3. All AI features unlimited
4. No confirmation modals (optional)
5. Can still buy tokens if needed
6. If cancels subscription → Falls back to tokens

---

## 🎮 Gamification (Future Enhancement)

Ready to implement:
- Daily login bonus: 1 token/day (max 5/week)
- Referral rewards: 20 tokens per referral
- Achievement bonuses:
  - First 100 tokens spent: +10 tokens
  - Power user (500 spent): +50 tokens
  - Champion (1000 spent): +100 tokens

Already have table: `referrals`
Already have function: Can use TokenService.addTokens()

## 💰 Revenue Projections

### Conservative Estimate (1,000 MAU)
- 30% buy tokens = 300 users
- Average purchase: $15 (Pro package)
- Monthly revenue: **$4,500**
- Annual revenue: **$54,000**

### With Subscriptions (Hybrid)
- 20% on subscription ($5/mo) = 200 users × $5 = **$1,000/mo**
- 20% buy tokens (occasional) = 200 users × $10 avg = **$2,000/mo**
- **Combined: $3,000/mo = $36,000/year**

### Best Case (10,000 MAU)
- Scale above numbers by 10x
- **$360,000/year** potential

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only access their own data
✅ **Server-side validation**: All token operations via API
✅ **Atomic transactions**: Balance updates are atomic
✅ **Webhook verification**: Stripe signatures verified
✅ **Service role keys**: Backend uses service role, not anon key
✅ **Metadata logging**: All transactions logged with metadata
✅ **Rate limiting**: Daily usage tracking prevents abuse
✅ **No client-side manipulation**: Balance stored server-side only

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Token purchase conversion rate** (visitors → buyers)
2. **Average purchase value** (which package is most popular)
3. **Token usage per feature** (which features cost most)
4. **Balance distribution** (how many users have 0, 1-50, 50-100, 100+ tokens)
5. **Subscription vs token split** (revenue breakdown)
6. **Feature usage frequency** (which features used most)
7. **Time to first purchase** (how long before user buys)
8. **Repeat purchase rate** (users who buy 2+ times)

### SQL Queries for Analytics

```sql
-- Total tokens purchased by all users
SELECT SUM(lifetime_purchased) as total_purchased FROM user_tokens;

-- Most popular features
SELECT
  metadata->>'feature_key' as feature,
  COUNT(*) as usage_count,
  SUM(ABS(amount)) as tokens_spent
FROM token_transactions
WHERE type = 'spent'
GROUP BY metadata->>'feature_key'
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;

-- Revenue by package
SELECT
  tp.name,
  COUNT(pu.*) as purchases,
  SUM(pu.amount_cents) / 100.0 as total_revenue
FROM token_purchases pu
JOIN token_packages tp ON tp.id = pu.package_id
WHERE pu.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY tp.name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- User balance distribution
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN balance = 0 THEN '0 tokens'
    WHEN balance BETWEEN 1 AND 50 THEN '1-50 tokens'
    WHEN balance BETWEEN 51 AND 100 THEN '51-100 tokens'
    WHEN balance BETWEEN 101 AND 500 THEN '101-500 tokens'
    ELSE '500+ tokens'
  END as balance_range,
  COUNT(*) as user_count
FROM user_tokens
GROUP BY balance_range
ORDER BY MIN(balance);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tokens not credited after payment
**Solution**: Check webhook logs in Stripe Dashboard. Verify webhook secret is correct.

### Issue: "Insufficient tokens" even after purchase
**Solution**: User may need to refresh. Check `user_tokens` table directly to verify balance.

### Issue: TokenGate not showing cost badge
**Solution**: Ensure `feature_key` matches exactly what's in `feature_costs` table.

### Issue: Stripe test mode vs production
**Solution**: Use different Stripe keys for test/prod. Never mix them.

### Issue: Migration fails
**Solution**: Check if tables already exist. Drop tables and re-run, or use IF NOT EXISTS.
