### **V2 Features**

#### **1. Resume Analysis**
**File**: `src/lib/services/ai-resume-analyzer.ts`

- Extracts skills (with proficiency levels)
- Identifies job titles from experience
- Detects industries, specializations
- Calculates years of experience
- Generates search keywords

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "skills": [
    { "name": "Azure", "proficiency": "expert" },
    { "name": "PowerShell", "proficiency": "advanced" }
  ],
  "jobTitles": ["Senior IT Manager", "Oracle Developer"],
  "industries": ["Technology", "Healthcare"],
  "experienceLevel": "senior",
  "yearsOfExperience": 10
}
```

---

#### **2. Deep Job Scoring (Per-Job Analysis)**
**File**: `src/lib/services/ai-job-scorer.ts`

Each job receives a comprehensive AI analysis:

**Score Breakdown (5 Categories)**:
```json
{
  "overallScore": 78,
  "breakdown": {
    "skillsMatch": 85,        // Technical skills alignment
    "experienceMatch": 75,    // Seniority level fit
    "roleAlignment": 80,      // Job responsibilities match
    "industryFit": 70,        // Industry experience
    "careerGrowth": 80        // Growth potential
  }
}
```

**Personalized Insights**:
```json
{
  "strengths": [
    "You have strong Azure cloud experience matching this role's requirements",
    "Your PowerShell automation skills are explicitly mentioned in the job description",
    "Your 10+ years in IT management aligns with the senior level expectation"
  ],
  "concerns": [
    "You may need more hands-on Kubernetes experience",
    "Your background lacks specific Terraform infrastructure-as-code projects"
  ],
  "bridgeGaps": [
    "Complete the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification",
    "Build 2-3 Terraform projects deploying multi-tier applications to GitHub",
    "Take the HashiCorp Terraform Associate certification course on Udemy"
  ],
  "recommendation": "Strong Match",
  "reasoning": "Your infrastructure management and cloud skills align well with this role. Address the Kubernetes and Terraform gaps through certifications and projects to become an excellent candidate."
}
```

**AI Prompt Strategy**:
- Uses second-person language ("You have...", "Your experience...")
- Requires SPECIFIC action items (course names, cert names, project ideas)
- NO generic advice like "improve skills" or "gain experience"
- References ACTUAL job requirements vs candidate's ACTUAL skills

**Cost**: ~$0.045 per job (deep analysis with 3000 tokens)

---

#### **3. Career-Level Recommendations (NEW!)**
**File**: `src/app/api/resume-job-search/route.ts:201-300`

After scoring all jobs, V2 generates **strategic career advice**:

**Example Recommendations**:
```
1. Your average match score of 68% suggests you're targeting roles that
   don't fully align with your IT Manager profile. Consider pivoting to
   IT Operations Manager or Director of IT positions.

2. To improve competitiveness for DevOps roles, obtain the AWS Solutions
   Architect Associate and Certified Kubernetes Administrator certifications.

3. Rewrite your resume emphasizing technical hands-on work (PowerShell
   scripts, Azure deployments) first, then management experience second.

4. Target hybrid roles: DevOps Manager, Cloud Infrastructure Lead, or SRE
   Team Lead where your management + technical skills create unique value.

5. Your Oracle ERP background is valuable - specifically search "Oracle
   Cloud Consultant" or "ERP Implementation Manager" roles.
```

**AI Analysis Includes**:
- Average match score across all jobs
- Top matching jobs vs. candidate profile
- Common requirements in top jobs
- Gap analysis between profile and market demand
- Specific certifications, courses, and portfolio projects by name

**Display Location**: Purple gradient card below resume analysis, above job listings

---

#### **4. Job Search Methods**

V2 uses multiple job sources:

**Primary**: Free Job Search Service
- `src/lib/services/free-job-search-service.ts`
- Aggregates: RemoteOK, Indeed, AngelList
- No API key required

**Secondary**: JSearch API (RapidAPI)
- Requires `RAPIDAPI_KEY` in `.env`
- Searches Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor
- Rate limited: 2 queries per search

**Fallback**: Mock data
- Used when APIs fail or keys missing
- Generates realistic test jobs

---

#### **5. User Preferences**

Users can specify:
- Preferred role/job title
- Location (city, state, country, or remote)
- Employment type (full-time, part-time, contract)
- Remote-only filter

Preferences are stored in `sessionStorage` and used for:
- Location filtering in job search

## V3: AI-First Intelligent Job Discovery

### **File Structure**

```
V3 Implementation Files:
├── src/app/resume-jobs-v3/
│   ├── page.tsx                           # Main UI component (enhanced)
│   └── [jobId]/page.tsx                   # Job details page (copied from V2)
├── src/app/api/ai-job-search/
│   └── route.ts                           # Intelligent job search API
```

---

### **V3 Features**

#### **1. Quick Career Assessment (The Key Differentiator)**
**File**: `src/app/api/ai-job-search/route.ts:135-187`

**Purpose**: Identify optimal roles **BEFORE** searching

```typescript
async function quickCareerAssessment(resume: ParsedResume): Promise<string[]>
```

**What It Analyzes**:
- Skills (top 15)
- Experience roles
- Years of experience
- Skill combinations that suggest pivots

**Assessment Rules**:
1. **Management + Technical Skills** → Suggests both leadership AND IC roles
2. **Infrastructure/Cloud Skills** → Suggests DevOps, SRE, Cloud Architect
3. **ERP/Database Background** → Suggests consultant, implementation, architect roles
4. **Broad IT Skills** → Suggests roles leveraging full breadth
5. **Mixed Seniority Levels** → Includes current level + one level up

**Example**:
```
Input: Senior IT Manager, Azure, VMware, PowerShell, Python, GitHub Actions

AI Analysis:
- Has management experience + strong technical skills
- Cloud expertise (Azure) suggests infrastructure roles
- Scripting (PowerShell, Python) indicates automation capability
- GitHub Actions shows modern DevOps awareness

Output: ["DevOps Engineer", "Cloud Architect", "Site Reliability Engineer",
         "IT Operations Manager", "Infrastructure Engineer"]
```

**Cost**: ~$0.0006 per search (200 tokens @ $3/MTok)

**Why This Matters**:
- Traditional search: User types "IT Manager" → gets IT Manager jobs
- V3 search: AI sees "IT Manager + cloud skills" → suggests DevOps, SRE → finds better-fit roles

---

#### **2. AI-Guided Search Query Generation**
**File**: `src/app/api/ai-job-search/route.ts:193-243`

**Input**:
- Parsed resume
- Suggested roles from career assessment

**Prompt Strategy**:
```
CANDIDATE PROFILE:
Skills: Azure, VMware, PowerShell, Python, GitHub Actions, ...
Experience: Senior IT Manager, Oracle Developer
Years: 10

RECOMMENDED ROLE TYPES (PRIORITIZE THESE):
DevOps Engineer, Cloud Architect, Site Reliability Engineer, IT Operations Manager

QUERY GENERATION RULES:
1. Create 5 diverse search queries
2. PRIORITIZE queries for the recommended role types above
3. Mix role titles with key technical skills
4. Include location if specified
5. Vary seniority levels (current + one level up)

IMPORTANT: Focus queries on the RECOMMENDED ROLES, not just the resume's current job title.
```

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "queries": [
    "DevOps Engineer Azure AWS Python automation",
    "Cloud Architect infrastructure migration VMware container",
    "Site Reliability Engineer Kubernetes monitoring Prometheus",
    "Senior Infrastructure Engineer cloud security disaster recovery",
    "IT Operations Manager DevOps CI/CD Azure pipelines"
  ]
}
```

**Before vs After Career Assessment**:

| Without Career Assessment | With Career Assessment |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| "Senior IT Manager cloud Azure" | "DevOps Engineer Azure Python automation" |
| "IT Director cybersecurity" | "Cloud Architect migration VMware" |
| "Cloud Infrastructure Manager" | "Site Reliability Engineer monitoring" |
| "Senior Systems Manager" | "Infrastructure Engineer CI/CD" |
| "IT Operations Manager" | "DevOps Manager cloud security" |

**Result**: Initial search queries now target pivot roles automatically!

---

#### **3. Lightweight Job Matching**
**File**: `src/app/api/ai-job-search/route.ts:245-332`

V3 uses **simpler matching** than V2 to reduce cost:

```json
{
  "matchScore": 85,
  "matchingSkills": ["Azure", "PowerShell", "Python"],
  "missingSkills": ["Kubernetes", "Terraform"],
  "recommendation": "Strong match, apply immediately"
}
```

**No per-job**:
- ❌ 5-category breakdown
- ❌ Detailed strengths/concerns
- ❌ Bridge gap action items per job

**Why**: V3 focuses on **volume** (finding the right roles) vs **depth** (analyzing each job)

**Cost**: ~$0.010 per job with caching (vs $0.045 in V2)

---

#### **4. Career-Level Recommendations**
**File**: `src/app/api/ai-job-search/route.ts:337-398`

Same as V2, generates 4-5 strategic recommendations:

**Example**:
```
1. Pivot your job search toward IT Infrastructure Manager, Cloud
   Infrastructure Engineer, or IT Operations Manager roles - your Azure,
   VMware, and cybersecurity expertise aligns with infrastructure leadership.

2. Add specific development project examples to your resume/portfolio -
   include GitHub links to applications you've built, APIs developed, or
   automation frameworks created.

3. Target hybrid roles that bridge your strengths: DevOps Engineer, Site
   Reliability Engineer (SRE), or Cloud Solutions Architect positions.

4. Obtain Azure Developer Associate or AWS Certified Developer certification
   to demonstrate commitment to transitioning to hands-on software development.

5. Rewrite resume with development-focused language: emphasize Python and
   PowerShell coding first, describe Oracle work as 'backend development',
   minimize management accomplishments.
```

**Display**: Purple gradient card prominently displayed on results page

---

#### **5. Refined Search (Optional)**
**File**: `src/app/api/ai-job-search/route.ts:479-541`

**Trigger**: User enables "Use AI recommendations to refine job search" checkbox

**Process**:
1. Analyzes career recommendations
2. Extracts new job titles mentioned (e.g., "Pivot to DevOps" → extracts "DevOps Engineer")
3. Runs additional searches for those roles
4. Merges with existing results
5. Deduplicates by job ID
6. Re-sorts by match score

**Example Flow**:
```
Initial Search (5 queries):
→ 25 jobs found

Career Recommendations Generated:
"Pivot to DevOps Engineer and SRE roles"

Refined Search Extraction:
→ ["DevOps Engineer", "Site Reliability Engineer", "SRE"]

Additional Search (3 queries):
→ 15 new jobs found

Final Results:
→ 37 unique jobs (25 + 15 - 3 duplicates), re-sorted
```

**UI Control**: Checkbox on upload form (enabled by default)

**Cost**: Additional ~$0.001 for extraction + job search costs

---

### **V3 API Endpoint**

**POST** `/api/ai-job-search`

**Request**:
```javascript
const formData = new FormData()
formData.append('resume', file) // PDF or TXT

    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Pivot your job search toward DevOps...",
    "Add specific development projects...",
    /* ... */
  ],
  "totalFound": 47,

### **Caching Strategy**

Both versions implement caching to reduce costs:

**V2 Caching**:
- Resume analysis: 24h cache per user
- Job scores: 24h cache per job-user pair
- Search results: 6h cache per query

**V3 Caching**:
- Resume analysis: 24h cache per user
- Career assessment: 24h cache per resume hash
- Search queries: 1h cache per resume hash
- Job matches: 6h cache

**Cache Keys**:
```typescript
// V2
`resume_analysis_${userId}_${resumeHash}`
`job_score_${userId}_${jobId}`

// V3
`career_assessment_${resumeHash}`
`search_queries_${resumeHash}`
`job_matches_${queryHash}`
```

## Cost Analysis

### **V2 Costs Per Search**

Assuming 20 jobs found:

| Step | Tokens | Cost | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Resume parsing | 2000 | $0.006 | One-time |
| Career assessment | 800 | $0.002 | Strategic recs |
| Job scoring (20 jobs) | 60000 | $0.900 | $0.045/job |
| **Total** | 62800 | **$0.908** | High quality |

**With Caching** (24h):
- First search: $0.908
- Repeat search same day: $0.002 (only career recs)
- **Effective cost**: $0.045-0.90 depending on cache hits

---

### **V3 Costs Per Search**

Assuming 30 jobs found (more jobs due to better queries):

| Step | Tokens | Cost | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Resume parsing | 2000 | $0.006 | One-time |
| Career assessment | 200 | $0.0006 | Quick analysis |
| Query generation | 500 | $0.0015 | 5 queries |
| Job matching (30 jobs) | 9000 | $0.027 | $0.009/job |
| Career recommendations | 600 | $0.0018 | Strategic advice |
| Refined search (optional) | 300 | $0.0009 | Extract + search |
| **Total** | 12600 | **$0.039** | Cost-effective |

**With Caching** (24h):
- First search: $0.039
- Repeat search same day: $0.002 (only recs + matching)
- **Effective cost**: $0.010-0.039

---

### **Cost Comparison Summary**

| Scenario | V2 Cost | V3 Cost | V3 Savings |
|----------|---------|---------|------------|
| Single search (no cache) | $0.908 | $0.039 | **95.7%** |
| Daily user (1 search/day) | $0.908 | $0.039 | **95.7%** |
| Power user (5 searches/day) | $0.95 | $0.05 | **94.7%** |
| Monthly (30 searches) | $27.24 | $1.17 | **95.7%** |

**V3 is ~96% cheaper while finding better-fit roles!**

---

### **Debugging Common Issues**

#### **Issue: Generic search queries in V3**
**Symptoms**: Queries like "Software Engineer JavaScript React" instead of pivot-specific

**Cause**: Career assessment not running or returning fallback

**Fix**:
1. Check terminal logs for: `✅ Career assessment suggests: ...`
2. If missing, check Anthropic API key is set
3. Verify model name: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
4. Check for errors in career assessment function

**Debug**:
```typescript
// In src/app/api/ai-job-search/route.ts
console.log('🎯 Career assessment input:', {
  skills: resume.skills.slice(0, 15),
  experience: resume.experience,
  years: resume.yearsExperience
})
```

---

#### **Issue: 404 on job details page**
**Symptoms**: Clicking job card shows 404

**Cause**: SessionStorage data not set properly

**Fix**:
```typescript
// In main page onClick handler:
sessionStorage.setItem('currentJob', JSON.stringify(job))
sessionStorage.setItem('allMatches', JSON.stringify(results.matches))

// In job details page:
const jobData = sessionStorage.getItem('currentJob')
if (!jobData) {
  console.error('No job data in sessionStorage')
  router.push('/resume-jobs-v3') // Redirect back
}
```

---

#### **Issue: High API costs**
**Symptoms**: Unexpectedly high Anthropic bills

**Cause**: Cache not working or excessive searches

**Debug**:
```sql
-- Check cache hit rates
SELECT
  cache_key,
  COUNT(*) as hits,
  MAX(created_at) as last_used
FROM ai_responses
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY cache_key
ORDER BY hits DESC;
```

**Fix**:
1. Verify Supabase connection
2. Check cache TTL settings
3. Implement rate limiting per user

---

## API Rate Limits & Best Practices

### **Anthropic Claude API**

**Tier 1 Limits** (Default):
- 50 requests per minute
- 40,000 tokens per minute
- 5,000 requests per day

**Best Practices**:
1. Implement exponential backoff on 429 errors
2. Use caching aggressively (24h for resume analysis)
3. Batch requests when possible
4. Monitor usage via Anthropic Console

---

### **RapidAPI (JSearch)**

**Free Tier**:
- 250 requests/month
