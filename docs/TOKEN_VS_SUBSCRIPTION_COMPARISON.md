# Token-Based vs Subscription Model: Detailed Comparison

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Start with Token-Based Model**

After analyzing both models, the **token-based pricing system** is more suitable for JobAI because:

‚úÖ Lower barrier to entry ($5 vs $5/month commitment)
‚úÖ Better for occasional users (no wasted subscription fees)
‚úÖ More transparent pricing (users see exact costs)
‚úÖ No churn management needed (tokens never expire)
‚úÖ Easier upsell path (just buy more tokens)
‚úÖ Aligns with AI product trends (OpenAI, Anthropic model)

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | Token Model | Subscription Model |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Entry Cost** | $5 one-time (100 tokens) | $5/month recurring |
| **Commitment** | None (pay once, use anytime) | Monthly/Annual commitment |
| **Expiration** | Never | Monthly (lose access if cancel) |
| **Flexibility** | Use when needed | Must use monthly or waste $ |
| **Revenue Model** | Variable (based on usage) | Predictable recurring |
| **User Psychology** | "I own these tokens" | "Another subscription" |
| **Churn Risk** | None (tokens persist) | High (must cancel actively) |
| **Pricing Complexity** | Medium (token costs per feature) | Low (one flat price) |
| **Best For** | Occasional + power users | Regular consistent users |

### Subscription Model

**Assumptions**:
- 1,000 monthly active users
- 15% convert to premium ($5/month)
- 5% churn rate per month

**Annual Revenue**:
- Month 1: 150 users √ó $5 = $750
- Month 2: 142 users √ó $5 = $710
- Month 12: 85 users √ó $5 = $425
- **Average: $565/month** = **$6,780/year**

### Winner: Token Model (~11x higher revenue potential)

## Implementation Complexity

### Token Model

**Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Users table
users (
  id,
  token_balance INT DEFAULT 0,
  tokens_lifetime_earned INT DEFAULT 0,
  tokens_lifetime_spent INT DEFAULT 0
)

-- Token transactions
token_transactions (
  id,
  user_id,
  amount INT,
  type ENUM('purchase', 'spent', 'earned', 'bonus'),
  description TEXT,
  balance_after INT,
  created_at
)

-- Token packages
token_packages (
  id,
  name VARCHAR,
  tokens INT,
  price_cents INT,
  discount_percent INT,
  stripe_price_id VARCHAR
)
```

**Middleware**: Check balance before AI actions
**API**: `POST /api/tokens/deduct` with action tracking
**UI**: Token balance everywhere, cost badges

### Subscription Model

**Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Users table
users (
  id,
  subscription_status ENUM('free', 'trial', 'active', 'canceled'),
  subscription_tier ENUM('basic', 'pro'),
  subscription_ends_at TIMESTAMP
)

-- Subscriptions
subscriptions (
  id,
  user_id,
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR,
  status VARCHAR,
  plan_id VARCHAR,
  current_period_end TIMESTAMP
)
```

**Middleware**: Check subscription status
**Webhooks**: Handle subscription events
**UI**: Upgrade prompts, subscription management

**Winner: Subscription (simpler implementation)**
