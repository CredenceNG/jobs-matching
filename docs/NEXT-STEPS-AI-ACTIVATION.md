---

## 🎯 Action Required: Add OpenAI Credits

Your OpenAI API key is **valid** but your account has **no credits remaining**. You need to add credits to unlock AI functionality.

### **Option 1: Add Credits to Existing OpenAI Account** (Recommended - 5 minutes)

This is the **fastest** option since your key is already configured.

#### Step 1: Go to OpenAI Billing
👉 https://platform.openai.com/account/billing

#### Step 2: Add Payment Method
- Click "Payment methods"
- Add credit/debit card
- Minimum: $5 (lasts 300-500 resume analyses)

#### Step 3: Add Credits
- Click "Add to credit balance"
- Recommended: **$10** (lasts 600-1000 searches)
- Budget-conscious: **$5** (lasts 300-500 searches)

#### Step 4: Verify Credits Added
```bash
# Run this to test
node test-ai-functionality.mjs
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ OpenAI: WORKING
   Response: "test"
   Cost: $0.000015
```

#### Step 5: Test Full System
```bash
npm run dev
# Go to http://localhost:3000/resume-jobs
# Upload a resume
# See AI-matched jobs! 🎉
```

### **Option 2: Get New Anthropic Claude Key** (Better Quality - 10 minutes)

Claude 3.5 Sonnet provides **better quality** AI analysis but costs slightly more.

#### Step 1: Create Anthropic Account
👉 https://console.anthropic.com/

#### Step 2: Get Free Credits
- New accounts get **$5 free credits**
- Enough for 75-100 resume analyses

#### Step 3: Create API Key
- Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
- Click "Create Key"
- Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-api03-...`)

#### Step 4: Update .env.local
```bash
nano .env.local
# Or use any text editor
```

Replace the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY line:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR-NEW-KEY-HERE
```

#### Step 5: Test
```bash
node test-api-keys.mjs
```

**Expected:**
```
✅ Anthropic: WORKING (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
   Response: "test"
```

---

### **Option 3: Use Both** (Best - Maximum Reliability)

1. Add credits to OpenAI ($5-10)
2. Get new Anthropic key (free $5 credits)
3. System uses Claude first, falls back to OpenAI if needed
4. Best quality + reliability
