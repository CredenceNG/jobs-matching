# üö® URGENT: API Subscription Required

## Problem

Your API keys are correct, but you need to **subscribe** to the JSearch API on RapidAPI.

## Solution for JSearch (RapidAPI)

### Step 1: Subscribe to JSearch API

1. **Go to**: https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch
2. **Login** with your RapidAPI account
3. **Click**: "Subscribe to Test" or "Pricing" button
4. **Choose**: "Basic" plan (FREE - 2,500 requests/month)
5. **Click**: "Subscribe" to confirm

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Having an API key is not enough - you MUST subscribe to each individual API on RapidAPI.

### Step 2: Verify Your Subscription

After subscribing, you should see:

- ‚úÖ "Subscribed" status on the JSearch API page
- ‚úÖ Your usage limits displayed
- ‚úÖ Access to test the API endpoints

## Alternative: Use Adzuna Only

If JSearch subscription doesn't work, let's fix the Adzuna API issue. The 401 error suggests the API key format might be wrong.

### Adzuna API Fix

From your screenshot, I saw these keys:

- App ID: `c0be6cc2` ‚úÖ (correct)
- API Key: Try the other key from your dashboard

Let me know which approach you prefer:

1. Subscribe to JSearch on RapidAPI (recommended - more job sources)
2. Fix Adzuna API only
3. Try both

## Quick Test
