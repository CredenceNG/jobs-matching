# 🔑 API Keys Required - System Cannot Work Without Them

## Current Status: ❌ BLOCKED

Both AI providers are failing authentication/quota checks:

### OpenAI API Key Status: ❌ QUOTA EXCEEDED

```
Error: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
```

**Current Key (in .env.local):**

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-tYUfoX8B_5TO8bS4Zx6r...
```

**Issue:** Account has no credits remaining

**Solution:**

1. Add credits to existing OpenAI account at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. OR get a new API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Anthropic Claude API Key Status: ❌ INVALID

```
{"type":"error","error":{"type":"authentication_error","message":"invalid x-api-key"}}
```

**Current Key (in .env.local):**

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-c3pJawXDw3_w3zVy3PC7...
```

**Issue:** Key is invalid or expired

**Solution:**

1. Get a new API key from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
2. Update .env.local with the new key

## Why We Can't Use "Basic Parser" Fallback

The entire architecture was redesigned specifically because basic keyword parsing was giving **terrible results**:

- ❌ Marketing Managers got Software Engineering jobs
- ❌ Hardcoded skill lists missed most professions
- ❌ No understanding of context or experience
- ❌ No intelligent job matching

**You specifically requested:**

> "Instead of writing fixed parser, is this not where AI comes in?"
> "Let's separate into 3 steps: Upload → AI Analyze → AI Score"

The 3-step AI architecture is **the solution**, not a nice-to-have. Without AI:

- We're back to the broken system you complained about
- No intelligent matching
- No profession-specific results
- Just random keyword matching

## What Needs to Happen

### Option 1: Use OpenAI (Recommended - More Economical)

1. Add credits to your OpenAI account
2. Costs: ~$0.01 per resume with GPT-3.5 Turbo
3. Update .env.local if needed

### Option 2: Use Anthropic Claude (Better Quality)

1. Get new Claude API key from console.anthropic.com
2. Costs: ~$0.05 per resume
3. Update ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env.local

### Option 3: Use Both (Best - Redundancy)

1. Fix both API keys
2. System tries Claude first
3. Falls back to OpenAI if Claude fails
4. Maximum reliability

## How to Update API Keys

### 1. Edit .env.local

```bash
nano .env.local
```

### 2. Update the keys:

```env
# OpenAI (for GPT models)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR-NEW-KEY-HERE

# Anthropic (for Claude models)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR-NEW-KEY-HERE
```

### 3. Restart the dev server:

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test it!

Upload a resume and you should see:

```
🤖 STEP 2: Analyzing resume with AI...
✅ AI Analysis Complete!
   - Skills found: 15
   - Job titles: Enterprise Agility Coach
   - Industries: Technology, Consulting
```

## Cost Estimates

### Per Resume Analysis:

- **GPT-3.5 Turbo:** ~$0.01 per resume
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** ~$0.05 per resume

### For Testing (10 resumes):

- **GPT-3.5 Turbo:** ~$0.10
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** ~$0.50

### Minimum to Get Started:

- **OpenAI:** $5 minimum deposit
- **Anthropic:** $5 free credits for new accounts

---

## The Bottom Line

**No AI = No Intelligent Job Matching**

The whole point of this rebuild was to fix the broken keyword matching. Without valid AI API keys, the system literally cannot work as designed.

**What You Need To Do:**

1. Choose a provider (or both)
2. Get valid API key(s) with credits
3. Update .env.local
4. Restart server
5. Test with your actual resume

That's it. Once you have valid keys, everything will work! 🚀

## Quick Start Guide

### If You Have OpenAI Account with Credits:

```bash
# 1. Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 2. Edit .env.local
nano .env.local

# 3. Replace the OPENAI_API_KEY line with your new key
# 4. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)
# 5. Restart server
npm run dev

# 6. Test at http://localhost:3000/resume-jobs
```

### If You Need New Account:

1. **OpenAI:** https://platform.openai.com/signup
   - Add $5 to start
   - Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. **Anthropic:** https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Get $5 free credits
   - Get API key from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

## Why Both Keys Failed

### OpenAI:

- You used up all credits
- Needs payment to continue
- Common with free trials

### Anthropic:

- Key format looks wrong (might be truncated?)
- Or account was deleted
- Or key was revoked

**Both are fixable** - just need valid keys with credits! 💳
