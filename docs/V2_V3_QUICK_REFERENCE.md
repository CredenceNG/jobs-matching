## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### "Search queries don't reflect my pivot"

**Problem**: V3 showing generic queries

**Check**:
```bash
# Terminal should show:
‚úÖ Career assessment suggests: DevOps Engineer, Cloud Architect...
üîç Suggested roles: DevOps Engineer, Cloud Architect...

# If missing, check:
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  # Must be set
echo $AI_DEFAULT_MODEL   # Must be claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

---

### "404 on job details page"

**Problem**: Click job ‚Üí 404 error

**Fix**: Clear sessionStorage
```javascript
// In browser console:
sessionStorage.clear()
// Reload page and search again
```

---

### "High API costs"

**Problem**: Bills higher than expected

**Check cache**:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL editor:
SELECT cache_key, COUNT(*) as hits
FROM ai_responses
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY cache_key;

-- Should see cache hits > 0
```

**Fix**: Verify Supabase connection in `.env`
