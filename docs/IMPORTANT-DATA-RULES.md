# üö® CRITICAL DATA RULES - READ FIRST üö®

## The Problem We Fixed

The system was showing **software engineering jobs to non-software professionals** because:

1. ‚ùå Resume parser only looked for tech skills (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
2. ‚ùå It ignored marketing, sales, HR, finance, and other professional skills
3. ‚ùå Job matching used generic queries instead of resume-specific keywords
4. ‚ùå System had hardcoded assumptions that all users are developers

## The Solution

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Resume Parsing

- Now extracts skills from **ALL professions**:
  - Marketing (SEO, Social Media, Content Marketing, etc.)
  - Sales (CRM, Lead Generation, Business Development, etc.)
  - HR (Recruiting, HRIS, Talent Acquisition, etc.)
  - Finance (Accounting, Financial Modeling, Excel, etc.)
  - Design (Photoshop, Figma, UI/UX, etc.)
  - Technical (JavaScript, Python, AWS, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Accurate Job Matching

- Uses **actual resume content** to search for jobs
- Extracts profession-specific keywords
- Matches jobs to the user's **actual** career field

## ABSOLUTE RULES FOR ALL CODE

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ NO HARDCODED DATA

```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
const jobs = [{ title: "Software Engineer", company: "Example Corp" }];

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS
const jobs = await jobSearchAPI.search(query);
if (!jobs || jobs.length === 0) {
  return []; // Empty array, not fake data
}
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ NO MOCK OR FALLBACK DATA

```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
catch (error) {
  return mockJobs; // Don't return fake data on error
}

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS
catch (error) {
  console.error("API failed:", error);
  return []; // Let UI show empty state
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ NO TECH-ONLY ASSUMPTIONS

```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
const skills = ["JavaScript", "React"]; // Only tech!

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS
const allSkills = [
  ...techSkills,
  ...marketingSkills,
  ...salesSkills,
  ...hrSkills,
  ...financeSkills,
  ...designSkills,
];
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ PARSE ACTUAL RESUME CONTENT

```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
const skills = ["C#", "Go", "AI"]; // Hardcoded default

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS
const skills = extractSkillsFromResumeText(resumeText);
// This must work for ALL professions, not just tech
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ MATCH JOBS TO RESUME

```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
searchJobs("software developer"); // Generic query

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS
const keywords = generateKeywordsFromResume(parsedResume);
searchJobs(keywords); // "marketing manager social media SEO"
```

## Files That Must Follow These Rules

### Critical Files:

1. **`src/lib/services/resume-parser.ts`**

   - ‚úÖ Now has comprehensive skill lists for ALL professions
   - Must extract actual skills from resume text
   - Cannot assume user is a developer

2. **`src/lib/services/job-search.ts`**

   - ‚úÖ Must only return real API data
   - No hardcoded job listings
   - No mock/fallback data

3. **`src/app/api/resume-job-search/route.ts`**
   - Must use parsed resume data for job search
   - Cannot use generic queries
   - Must validate data comes from APIs

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying any code, verify:

- [ ] No hardcoded job listings anywhere
- [ ] No mock data in production code paths
- [ ] Resume parser supports non-tech professions
- [ ] Job searches use resume-specific keywords
- [ ] Marketing manager resume returns marketing jobs
- [ ] Sales rep resume returns sales jobs
- [ ] HR recruiter resume returns HR jobs
- [ ] Empty states shown properly (no fake data)

## User Experience Goals

**What users should see:**

- ‚úÖ Jobs that match their actual profession
- ‚úÖ Results relevant to their skills and experience
- ‚úÖ Real job listings from actual companies
- ‚úÖ Accurate match scores based on their resume

**What users should NEVER see:**

- ‚ùå Software jobs when they're not in software
- ‚ùå "Example Company" or placeholder data
- ‚ùå Irrelevant results that waste their time
- ‚ùå Generic jobs that ignore their profile

## Remember

**Every line of code should ask:**

1. Is this data real (from an API)?
2. Is this data relevant (matched to user's actual resume)?
3. Does this work for ALL professions, not just tech?
4. Would a marketing manager get good results with this code?

If the answer to any question is NO ‚Üí Fix it before committing.

**Updated**: After fixing the hardcoded tech-only resume parser
**Status**: System now properly supports all professions
**Next**: Ensure job matching quality is maintained
