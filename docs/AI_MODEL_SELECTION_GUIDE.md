## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP
```javascript
// Use Claude for everything (simplicity > cost)
const AI_CONFIG = {
  defaultModel: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  // Cost: $0.066 per user
  // Easy to implement, one API
}
```

### Phase 2: Optimize
```javascript
// Hybrid approach (recommended)
const AI_CONFIG = {
  parsing: "gpt-4o-mini",
  queries: "gpt-4o-mini",
  matching: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  coverLetter: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  resumeOptimization: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  interviewPrep: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  simpleTasks: "gpt-4o-mini"
}
// Cost: $0.0566 per user (14% savings)
```

### Phase 3: Scale (10K+ users)
```javascript
// Add caching + model routing
const AI_CONFIG = {
  // Use cheaper models with aggressive caching
  parsing: "gpt-4o-mini",  // Cache 24h
  queries: "gpt-4o-mini",  // Cache 6h
  matching: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",  // Cache 4h

  // Premium features always use Claude
  coverLetter: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  resumeOptimization: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",

  // Cache hit rate: 60-80%
  // Effective cost: $0.015 per user
}
```

---

## Model Switching Logic

```typescript
// src/lib/ai/model-selector.ts

function selectModel(task: AITask, context: TaskContext): ModelConfig {
  // For simple extraction/parsing
  if (task.complexity === 'low' && task.outputType === 'structured') {
    return { model: 'gpt-4o-mini', reason: 'structured_task' }
  }

  // For critical user-facing content
  if (task.userFacing && task.qualityImportant) {
    return { model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5', reason: 'quality_critical' }
  }

  // For complex reasoning
  if (task.requiresReasoning && task.contextLength > 5000) {
    return { model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5', reason: 'complex_reasoning' }
  }

  // For high-volume, cost-sensitive tasks
  if (context.volume > 1000 && task.complexity === 'low') {
    return { model: 'gpt-4o-mini', reason: 'cost_optimization' }
  }

  // Default to Claude for uncertainty
  return { model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5', reason: 'default_quality' }
}
```
