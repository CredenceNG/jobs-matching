# 🎯 3-Step AI-Powered Job Matching Architecture

## Overview

A clean, AI-first approach to job matching that ensures accuracy at every step.

## Step 1: Upload Resume

**Goal:** Get the user's resume into the system

**User Action:**

- Upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT file
- Drag & drop or file picker

**System Action:**

- Extract text from file (using proper PDF/DOCX parsers)
- Validate file content (minimum length, format)
- Show preview of extracted text to user
- Store for processing

**Output:**

```typescript
{
  fileName: "Resume2021.pdf",
  fileSize: "245KB",
  extractedText: "Full resume text...",
  extractedLength: 5420
}
```

## Step 2: AI Resume Analysis

**Goal:** Use ChatGPT/Claude to deeply understand the candidate's profile

**Why AI Here:**

- ✅ Understands context and nuance (not just keyword matching)
- ✅ Extracts implicit skills (e.g., "led team of 10" → Leadership, Management)
- ✅ Identifies career level accurately
- ✅ Understands industry jargon across ALL fields
- ✅ No hardcoded skill lists needed

**AI Prompt:**

```
Analyze this resume and extract detailed information:

Resume:
{resumeText}

Extract:
1. Skills (technical, soft skills, tools, platforms)
2. Job titles held and years of experience
3. Industries worked in
4. Current career level (entry/mid/senior/executive)
5. Key achievements and specializations
6. Preferred job types (if mentioned)
7. Location preferences (if mentioned)

Return structured JSON with confidence scores.
```

**Output:**

```typescript
{
  skills: [
    { name: "Social Media Marketing", confidence: 0.95, category: "marketing" },
    { name: "Content Strategy", confidence: 0.90, category: "marketing" },
    { name: "SEO", confidence: 0.88, category: "marketing" },
    { name: "Brand Management", confidence: 0.85, category: "marketing" },
    { name: "Google Analytics", confidence: 0.92, category: "analytics" }
  ],
  jobTitles: ["Marketing Manager", "Digital Marketing Specialist"],
  industries: ["E-commerce", "SaaS", "Digital Media"],
  experienceLevel: "senior",
  yearsOfExperience: 8,
  specializations: ["B2B Marketing", "Product Launch", "Team Leadership"],
  preferredJobTypes: ["Full-time", "Remote"],
  location: "Remote" | "New York, NY",
  careerGoal: "Senior marketing leadership role in tech/SaaS",
  summary: "Senior marketing professional with 8+ years..."
}
```

## Step 3: AI-Powered Job Search & Matching

**Goal:** Find relevant jobs AND use AI to score each match

### 3A: Search for Jobs

**Search Query Generation:**
Use AI analysis to create targeted search queries:

```typescript
// Generate from Step 2 analysis
const searchQueries = [
  "Marketing Manager Social Media E-commerce",
  "Senior Digital Marketing SaaS",
  "Brand Manager Content Strategy",
];

// Search multiple APIs in parallel
const jobs = await Promise.all([
  remoteOKAPI.search(query1),
  adzunaAPI.search(query2),
  jSearchAPI.search(query3),
]);
```

**Job Sources:**

- RemoteOK API
- Adzuna API
- JSearch API (RapidAPI)
- Others as available

### 3B: AI Match Scoring

**For EACH job, use ChatGPT/Claude to score the match:**

**AI Prompt:**

```
You are an expert recruiter. Analyze how well this job matches the candidate's profile.

Candidate Profile:
{resumeAnalysis from Step 2}

Job Listing:
Title: {job.title}
Company: {job.company}
Description: {job.description}
Requirements: {job.requirements}
Location: {job.location}
Salary: {job.salary}

Analyze and score (0-100):
1. Skills Match - How many required skills does candidate have?
2. Experience Match - Does experience level align?
3. Role Alignment - Is this the right type of role?
4. Industry Fit - Does industry experience match?
5. Career Growth - Is this a good next step?

Return:
{
  overallScore: 85,
  breakdown: {
    skillsMatch: 90,
    experienceMatch: 85,
    roleAlignment: 88,
    industryFit: 82,
    careerGrowth: 80
  },
  strengths: [
    "Strong skills match - 8/10 required skills",
    "Experience level perfectly aligned",
    "Industry experience in SaaS/E-commerce"
  ],
  concerns: [
    "Location: On-site in SF (candidate prefers remote)",
    "Salary slightly below current range"
  ],
  recommendation: "Strong Match",
  shouldApply: true,
  reasoning: "This role aligns well with your marketing leadership experience..."
}
```

## Step 4: Present Results
